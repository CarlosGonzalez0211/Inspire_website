                <p><strong>Creating learning activities</strong> involves designing and implementing educational
                        experiences that help learners acquire new knowledge, skills, and competencies. Effective
                        learning activities are designed with specific Learning Objectives[BC1]  in mind and are
                        tailored to the needs, interests, and abilities of the learners.</p>

                <p><strong>Don’t Over Prepare</strong></p>
                <p>While some level of planning and preparation is necessary for effective teaching, it is important to
                        find a balance that allows for flexibility, creativity, and student engagement.</p>

                <p><strong>Drawbacks to Overpreparing</strong></p>
                <ul>
                        <li>
                                <strong>Decreased flexibility.</strong> Over-preparing limits your ability to adapt to
                                unexpected circumstances, address gaps in student knowledge, or to incorporate new ideas
                                and perspectives.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                                <strong>Reduced creativity.</strong> If you are overly focused on following a specific
                                plan, you may miss opportunities to experiment with new strategies or to think
                                creatively about how to engage students.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                                <strong>Increased stress.</strong> Over-preparing can be time-consuming and stressful,
                                particularly if you feel that you must adhere strictly to a plan.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                                <strong>Burnout.</strong> Over-preparing can also contribute to burnout, leaving you
                                feeling overwhelmed and overworked.
                        </li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Benefits to Balanced Preparation</strong></p>
                <ul>
                        <li>
                                <strong>Increased spontaneity.</strong> You can be more spontaneous and open to new
                                ideas, which can lead to more engaging and dynamic lesson.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                                <strong>Improved student engagement. </strong> When you are more flexible and open to
                                student input, it can create a more interactive and engaging classroom environment.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                                <strong>Greater satisfaction.</strong> Being adequately prepared, but not overly so, can
                                make you more relaxed and confident in your ability to teach, leading to greater job
                                satisfaction and reduced burnout.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                                <strong>More efficient use of time.</strong> You have more time, allowing you to focus
                                on student support or professional development.
                        </li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Creating Effective Learning Activities</strong></p>
                <ul>
                        <li>
                                <strong>Identify the relevant learning objectives.</strong> Start by identifying the
                                specific skills, knowledge, and competencies you want learners to acquire. This will
                                guide you in designing activities that meet those objectives.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                                <strong>Make Activities Accessible.</strong> Consider the age, educational background,
                                interests, and learning style of your potential students. This will help you to tailor
                                the learning activity to meet their needs and preferences.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                                <strong>Select appropriate materials.</strong> These can include textbooks, handouts,
                                videos, simulations, and other multimedia resources. Consider using <a
                                        href="https://www.utep.edu/library/oer/"
                                        style="color:blue; text-decoration: underline;" target="_blank">Open Educational
                                        Resources</a> (OER)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                                <strong>Design the learning activity.</strong> Create an engaging and interactive
                                learning activity that helps learners to achieve the learning objectives. This can
                                involve a variety of strategies such as group discussions, role-playing,
                                problem-solving, case studies, or quizzes.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                                <strong>Incorporate assessment.</strong> Include formative and summative Assessments
                                that measure the learners' progress toward the learning objectives.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                                <strong>Evaluate and revise.</strong> Finally, evaluate the effectiveness of the
                                learning activity and revise it as needed to improve learner outcomes.
                        </li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>In-Class Activities</strong></p>
                <p>It is important to explain the purpose of learning activities because it helps learners to understand
                        the purpose and relevance of what they are learning. This helps to build trust and rapport
                        between you and your students. When they understand why they are being asked to do certain tasks
                        or to learn certain concepts, they are more likely to see their instructors as allies in their
                        learning journey rather than as arbitrary authority figures.
                </p>

                <p><strong>Open-ended Discussion Questions</strong></p>
                <p>Open-ended discussion questions are an effective way to engage students in meaningful and
                        thought-provoking conversations. They are designed to elicit a variety of responses and
                        encourage critical thinking and analysis and encourage students to express their opinions, share
                        their experiences, and think creatively.
                </p>
                <ul>
                        <li>
                                <strong>Start with the learning objectives.</strong> Think about what you want students
                                to learn and how a discussion can help them achieve that learning goal.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                                <strong>Make the questions challenging.</strong> Questions should be challenging and
                                thought-provoking, encouraging students to think critically and creatively.
                        <li>
                                <strong>Encourage analysis and synthesis.</strong> Encourage students to analyze and
                                synthesize, rather than simply recalling facts or information. Ask questions that
                                require students to apply their knowledge and skills to new situations.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                                <strong>Make the questions relevant.</strong> Questions should relate to students' lives
                                and experiences, making them more engaging and motivating. This can be achieved by
                                relating the questions to current events or real-world examples.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                                <strong>Provide context.</strong> It's important to provide context for the questions,
                                helping students understand the relevance and importance of the topic being discussed.
                                Provide background information, relevant readings or resources, or frame the questions
                                within a broader context
                        </li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>“Pass the Mic” Concept Review</strong></p>
                <p>Instead of holding a full review of all concepts, allow your students to take part in the review
                        process:</p>
                <ul>
                        <li>
                                Well before the review, ask students for two to five key terms or concepts they feel
                                they haven't learned fully. Create a review sheet from their answers.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                                Present the list to the class. Instruct students to have their previous class notes and
                                be prepared to take new ones.
                        <li>
                                Use a trinket (i.e., a plush ball) as a “microphone” to help determine who is actively
                                participating. The student who holds the “mic” picks one term/concept from the list and,
                                using their notes, can offer up what they already know, what they are unsure of, or what
                                they need more elaboration on.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                                Once the speaker has finished, open the floor to the rest of the class for questions or
                                additional comments.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                                If you find that the discussion has taken a departure from the right direction,
                                re-center the class and provide further elaboration if necessary.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                                Erase each term discussed from the list as you go, have the speaker pass the “mic” to a
                                fellow classmate, and keep tossing the ball around after each concept/term is discussed.
                        </li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Think-Pair-Share</strong></p>
                <p>Think-pair-share is a collaborative learning strategy that involves three phases: think, pair, and
                        share. This flexible strategy is often used in classrooms of different disciplines to promote
                        active learning, student engagement, and peer-to-peer learning. It can help students develop
                        critical thinking skills and to see different perspectives on a topic. By sharing their ideas
                        with others, students can gain a deeper understanding of the material and build confidence in
                        their own abilities.
                </p>

                <p>Here's how it works:</p>
                <ul>
                        <li>
                                <strong>Think.</strong> Pose a question, problem, or topic for discussion, and give
                                students time to think about their response. They can jot down notes or ideas in their
                                notebooks or on a worksheet.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                                <strong>Pair.</strong> Put students in groups of 2 or 3. They may share their thoughts
                                and opinions, compare notes, and ask questions to clarify their understanding. This
                                stage provides an opportunity for students to practice active listening and to learn
                                from their peers.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                                <strong>Share.</strong> Have the groups share their ideas with the class. One student
                                from each pair may be asked to share, or pairs may be asked to collaborate and share
                                their ideas together.
