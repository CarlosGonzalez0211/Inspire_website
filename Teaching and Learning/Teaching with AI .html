                <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology refers to the development and implementation of computational
                        systems that possess the ability to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence.
                        Ideally, these tasks enable individuals to engage in a wide range of activities including
                        learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, language understanding, and decision-making.
                        Within educational contexts, understanding what AI tools exist to support these activities and
                        developing individuals’ AI literacy (their ability to comprehend, critically evaluate, and apply
                        AI output) is of essential importance.

                <p><strong>Examples of AI Tools in Higher Education</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Generative AI Tools</strong></p>

                <p>
                        Generative AI refers to a class of AI models and systems that has the ability to generate new
                        content, data, or outputs that resemble and, in some cases, are indistinguishable from
                        human-created content. These systems are designed to identify patterns and structures from
                        existing data and then use that knowledge to create novel outputs.

                <p><strong>To explore Generative AI programs in greater depth:</strong></p>
                <p>Keep lectures short and focused on concepts that students struggle most with. Consider
                        breaking up your lecture into smaller topics, allowing for collaboration and activities
                        to guide students to learn concepts. Or, save class time for activities alone and flip
                        your classroom, requiring short, low-stakes assessments or discussion posts before class
                        to be sure that students come prepared to use what they have learned.

                <p><strong>Recommendations for discussing AI Technology use in your Course</strong></p>
                <p>
                        We suggest that you discuss your policies with your students directly, specifically when
                        approaching
                        assignments that may encourage AI use.
                </p>

                <p><strong>Set clear expectations</strong></p>
                <p>
                        It is important to have clear policies outlining whether the use of AI is permitted for all,
                        some, or no course activities. Please consider including the following elements in your
                        syllabus:
                </p>

                <ul>
                        <li>Examples of what constitutes AI.</li>

                        <li>Language that states when, why, and how AI may or may not be used for assignments.</li>

                        <li>An explanation of how AI either assists or undermines learning goals.</li>

                        <li>Clear policies for what will happen if a violation occurs.</li>

                        <li>A reminder to students that they are responsible for any and all work that they put
                                their name to, regardless of whether or not they used AI to complete it</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Establish transparency in student learning goals</strong></p>
                <p>
                        Tell the students your rationale for allowing the use of AI on certain assignments but not on
                        others. Telling them what knowledge and skills they will develop by completing an activity can
                        help mitigate the temptation to use AI in a way that undermines a learning exercise. If your aim
                        is to enhance students’ AI literacy, include this as an explicit learning goal or objective for
                        your course or for specific lessons.
                </p>
                <ul>
                        <li>
                                Discuss how unauthorized use of AI may be handled in your course.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                                Below are things to consider for developing a policy for unauthorized use in your
                                classroom.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                                Determine at what point AI use in your classroom is unacceptable, and make that boundary
                                clear.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                                Discuss how disciplinary referrals will be made if that boundary is crossed. Any
                                investigation or disciplinary measures for academic dishonesty must be handled through
                                the Office of Student Conduct & Conflict Resolution (OSCCR) at UTEP. <a

                <p><strong>Empower students to take responsibility for their work</strong></p>
                <p>It is important to impress upon your students the fact that if they are putting their name on an
                        assignment, they must take complete responsibility for its contents. That means that if the AI
                        program generates content that does not adhere to the assignment, makes logical errors, or fails
                        to adequately think through a problem, the resulting grade will belong to the student, not the
                        AI program.
                </p>
                <ul>
                        <li>Remind students that AI cannot reproduce critical thought, reflection, or personal insights
                        </li>
                        <li>Discuss with your student that AI is only a tool to be used, but it does not replace human
                                intellect</li>
                        <li>Discuss with students the ethical as well as practical ramifications of using falsified
                                information and references, which generative AI content often includes (as applicable)
                        </li>

                <p><strong>FAQs</strong></p>
                <p><strong>What AI technologies are permitted for use in my course(s)?</strong></p>
                <p>
                        Currently, there are no restrictions on the types of AI technologies that you can incorporate
                        into your course(s). However, please be mindful that some AI tools have a financial cost
                        associated with them and so may be inaccessible to individuals in the learning environment.
                </p>

                <p><strong>Do I need to obtain approval to use AI in my course(s) from my department/division head or
                                other administrator at UTEP?</strong></p>
                <p>
                        There is no University-wide requirement to obtain such approval, though specific units may have
                        rules about standardization of certain courses or curricula; while we encourage open discussion
                        about AI use in teaching and learning contexts, approval is not explicitly required from any
                        party. If you have concerns about data or information privacy, we strongly encourage you to

                <p><strong>Can I make use of SafeAssign or Turnitin to screen student work for AI plagiarism?</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                        SafeAssign does not currently possess AI detection capabilities, and UTEP does not have an
                        institutional license for Turnitin. More importantly, perhaps, research (e.g., <a

                                Perkins et al., 2023</a>) suggests that detection software can produce many false
                        positives, labeling individuals as plagiarists when that is not actually the case. For these
                        reasons, if you suspect plagiarism, please directly refer the case to the Office of Student
                        Conduct and Conflict Resolution (OSCCR; see below).

                        While there are now innumerable online resources available regarding the instructional use of AI
                        technologies, we encourage you to attend the “Teaching with AI” workshop series offered by
