                <p><strong>Technology has come a long way</strong> in making the teaching and learning experience more
                        efficient and effective. Educational tools can help students become more self-motivated and
                        reliant and help faculty streamline the process of grading and communicating with students.
                        These tools can provide opportunities for students and faculty to connect inside and outside the
                        classroom, regardless of the course modality. </p>
