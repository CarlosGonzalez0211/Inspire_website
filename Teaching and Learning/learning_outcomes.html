                <p>Course Learning Goals/Outcomes help determine the types of content and activities a course will need.
                        These will be found as part of the course overview or description and give students an idea of
                        what they can hope to learn or achieve at the end of the course. </p>
                <p>Student Learning Objectives (SLOs) provide the road map for student success by being clearly defined
                        and measurable. Assessments and activities in the course should be aligned to these objectives,
                        demonstrating how they will lead students to meet overall course goals. </p>
