                <p>Active learning is a student-centered teaching approach championed for its ability to promote
                        instructor-student and student-student interaction and engagement with course concepts (rather
                        than passive participation). Through immersion in authentic and relevant activities,
                        opportunities for collaboration, and frequent and specific feedback, students are positioned as
                        co-creators of knowledge in the learning environment. Below are several common active learning
                        approaches and considerations that one might adopt in the classroom and beyond.

                <p><strong>Lecture less</strong></p>
                <p>Keep lectures short and focused on concepts that students struggle most with. Consider
                        breaking up your lecture into smaller topics, allowing for collaboration and activities
                        to guide students to learn concepts. Or, save class time for activities alone and flip
                        your classroom, requiring short, low-stakes assessments or discussion posts before class
                        to be sure that students come prepared to use what they have learned.
                </p>

                <p><strong>Encourage collaboration</strong></p>
                <p>Collaborative/Cooperative learning requires that a student becomes actively engaged in the
                        concepts of the class while teaching them how to value the perspectives and
                        contributions of others as a means of deepening their own understanding.

                <p>
                        Many students do not come to college truly understanding how to think critically about what they
                        learn, how they learn, or how to best use what they learn. Along with the knowledge and skills
                        necessary to be professionally successful, students need guidance to become self-motivated and
                        self-managed in their own learning process.

                                <strong>Metacognition</strong> is an individual’s knowledge of and ability to control
                                their own learning process and understanding of concepts. Students may not always be
                                aware of these things and can greatly benefit from learning activities that lead them
                                towards self-reflection and self-regulation of the ways they learn best. Learn more

                <p>
                        Blackboard, UTEP’s Learning Management System, is a great tool that allows faculty to provide
                        students an opportunity to organize and collaborate outside of the classroom. These interactions
                        can be structured or free and help students to build their sense of social presence and learning
                        community.

                <p><strong>Provide feedback</strong></p>
                <p>
                        Arguably the most important element of the learning environment is specific, guiding feedback
                        that meets the learner where they are and helps them to move forward. It is best to analyze
                        elements of a required task or skill test to determine what is most important for students to
                        learn and focus feedback on those elements.
